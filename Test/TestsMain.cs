				///		post gis database

				/// 
				/// 
				/// I will use strings for the data source, and test what it contains

				/// Data output
				/// The default for an output will be the same form as the input
				/// most actors will have one output?
				/// the out put destination will be dynamically resloved similar to the inputs 
				///		may be local file
				///		network file
				///		data base?
				/// 
				/// These steps need to generate metadata
