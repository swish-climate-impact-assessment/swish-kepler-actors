===================


The SWISH Kepler Actors we have built enable users to include Stata programs (http://www.stata.com/) into Kepler workflow.

These actors currently work with Stata 12 in Windows environments.

We provide a installer that makes the SWISH Kepler Actors available for use in Kepler. It is fully described and can be downloaded from this page

To run the installer double click the “Install” shortcut, to remove use the “Uninstall” shortcut.

The installed actors appear in Kepler components panel located on the left of the main Kepler window. In Kepler the actors can be dragged and dropped onto the canvas, and linked to other actors to create workflows.
